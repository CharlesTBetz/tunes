## Charlie's music

I've been a musician of some sort since 4th grade, took a run at a professional career but it didn't work out. 

I have a number of "songs in me" that I do want to share as best I can and to the extent that people are interested. 

For now, this repo will just hold the lighter weight artifacts I want to share: chopro-based lyrics & chords, PDF leadsheets, notated sheet music (where I have the patience to create), maybe MIDI files, and musical commentary. 

What's Chopro? A lightweight song sheet standard. Very cool. Check it out [here](https://www.chordpro.org/chordpro/).
