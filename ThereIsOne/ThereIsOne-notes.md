# Some notes about There is One. 

I woke up with the refrain of this song in my head on February 25th, 2020. Music and lyrics flowed naturally afterwards, at a rate I haven't experienced in some time. As I mention in the intro to the video, I feel the human race is undergoing some hard lessons about unity and taking care of each other currently. I released it on 3/27 tagged #SongsOfComfort. I took a run at being a professional musician and as a result I'm painfully aware of my limitations. But if it makes one person feel a little better it's worth it. 

## Musical structure. 
The song starts with what in the classic Great American Songbook form is a [sectional verse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty-two-bar_form), a rubato, recitative section to set up the main theme. This is not heard in popular music anymore but is still a staple of musicals and even current musical movies. 

It then moves into an older verse-chorus style (it is not a hook-based song), with a bridge and a final chorus modulated 1/2 step up. 

The I-iii progression often appeals to me as an alternative to standard three-chord or [ice cream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%2750s_progression) changes. Note that The Weight also is based on an initial I-iii move (although a very different song otherwise). Harmonic choices also included use of subtonic (flat 7 chord, in this case D in the key of E major) which is not an uncommon move but does distinguish it a bit (think Alison by Elvis Costello). The alternative would have been the ii chord (i.e. F#m) which just sounded too bland to me. 

I opted for a minor 7th on the refrain iii and the verse ii and iii, for a bit more subtlety. On the final chorus, it's just a straight minor chord (at that point the m7 would be too muddy). 

The half step up is a dramatic move, often used in more formal music and sometimes cabaret but not something heard in popular music that much (can be technically tricky). One pop song that uses it to great effect is Rainbow Connection. I deliberately foreshadowed it in the sectional verse closing V7 - bVI - V7 cadence.  

Overall, it's a bit too long to be a pop song but I hope might work around campfires, song circles and perhaps with a choral treatment. I might experiment with that. 

## Lyrics
Lyrics focus on broad, postive imagery of hope, love, a journey to better times, unity, and so forth. 

## Songwriter's critique. 
It's cliched. Deliberately. I have written songs that bent over backwards to avoid cliches. This one embraces them fully. In part, since songs like this seem to have a mind of their own, I see myself more as a transcriber than a  composer. But still, I tried to show more than I told (standard songwriters' advice) and as above also tried to spice things up harmonically a bit, without sounding contrived. 

The verses ("Let's go on a journey ... 3.4.1.2.3. We know you are strong ... 3.4.1.2.3...") are a bit musically odd. They start with a dense rhythmic phrase and then have an unusually long sustain, which I intend to exploit with backup instruments and voices as I elaborate the work. But they are what "came through." 

## Performance critique. 
I am not a great singer. When I am on, I am OK, but I lack training and there are some slightly flat notes and other notes where I am in tune but not singing quite correctly in terms of vowel sound and mouth shape. (I did about twenty takes.) Guitar is passable, some slop with not muting the top E string a couple places. This performance is a rough-in and I'll be re-recording the guitar and vocal separately, vocal with the assistance of a professional coach. Or, perhaps I will find someone else to sing it. Interested? I have no particular desire to be a singer as well as a songwriter at this stage of my life. 

## Arrangement
I think the song could rock. It builds nicely and I had to hold myself back somewhat on the last chorus. I'll be adding bass, drums, perhaps keys, certainly backup vocals, maybe an instrumental break (perhaps extending the bridge 4 bars for a guitar solo). 

Anyways, hope you enjoy this.
