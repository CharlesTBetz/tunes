# Some notes about There is One. 

I woke up with the refrain of this song in my head on February 25th, 2020. Music and lyrics flowed naturally afterwards, at a rate I haven't experienced in some time. As I mention in the intro to the video, I feel the human race is undergoing some hard lessons about unity and taking care of each other currently.

## Musical structure. 
The song starts with what in the classic Great American Songbook form is a [sectional verse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty-two-bar_form), a rubato, recitative section to set up the main theme. This is not seen in popular music anymore but is still a staple of musicals and even current musical movies. 

It then moves into an older verse-chorus style (it is not a hook-based song), with a bridge and a final chorus modulated 1/2 step up. 

Harmonic choices include use of subtonic (flat 7 chord, in this case D in the key of E major) which is not an uncommon move but does distinguish it a bit (think Alison by Elvis Costello). The alternative would have been the ii chord (i.e. F#m) which just sounded too bland to me. The I-iii progression often appeals to me as an alternative to standard three-chord or [ice cream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%2750s_progression) changes. Note that The Weight also is based on an initial I-iii move (although a very different song otherwise). 

I also opted for a minor 7th on the refrain iii and the verse ii and iii, for a bit more subtlety. On the final chorus, it's just a straight minor chord (at that point the m7 would be too muddy). 

Overall, it's a bit too long to be a pop song but I hope might work around campfires, song circles and perhaps with a choral treatment. I might experiment with that. 

## Lyrics
Lyrics focus on broad, postive imagery of hope, love, a journey to better times, unity, and so forth. 

## Songwriter's critique. 
It's cliched. Deliberately. I have written songs that bent over backwards to avoid cliches. This one embraces them fully. In part, since songs like this seem to have a mind of their own, I see myself more as a transcriber than a  composer. But still, I tried to show more than I told (standard songwriters' advice) and as above also tried to spice things up harmonically a bit, without sounding contrived. 

The verses ("Let's go on a journey ... 3.4.1.2.3. We know you are strong ... 3.4.1.2.3...") are a bit musically odd. They start with a dense rhythmic phrase and then have an unusually long sustain, which I intend to exploit with backup instruments and voices as I elaborate the work. But they are what "came through." 

## Performance critique. 
I am not a great singer. When I am on, I am OK, but I lack training and there are some slightly flat notes and other notes where I am in tune but not singing quite correctly in terms of vowel sound and mouth shape. (I did about twenty takes.) Guitar is passable, some slop with not muting the top E string a couple places. This performance is a rough-in and I'll be re-recording the guitar and vocal separately, vocal with the assistance of a professional coach. Or, perhaps I will find someone else to sing it. Interested? I have no particular desire to be a singer as well as a songwriter at this stage of my life. 

## Arrangement
I think the song could rock. It builds nicely and I had to hold myself back somewhat on the last chorus. I'll be adding bass, drums, perhaps keys, certainly backup vocals, maybe an instrumental break (perhaps extending the bridge 4 bars for a guitar solo). 

Anyways, hope you enjoy this.
